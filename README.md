# Conner Ngadisastra
Hi! My name is Conner and I am a first year Information Systems and Data Analytics student at Seattle Pacific University. I mainly code in C++ and Python but I also have experience with Java, JavaScript, Pandas, HTML, and CSS. I like to code projects that require lots of math and logic, and I am interested in learning more about machine learning and coding prediction models.
